<h2>Comparing approaches to multivariate data analysis</h2>

There has been much development in the last ~decade which promote the use of
model-based approaches to the analysis of the multivariate taxon data that
is commonly used in ecology.

Model-based approaches such as those adopted in R packages such as _mvabund_, _gllvm_, and
_Hmsc_ provide an alternative to the traditional approaches found in popular R
packages such as _vegan_ and commercial software packages such as _CANOCO_ and 
_PRIMER-E_ which have utlised distance-based approaches such as _ANOSIM_, and 
_PERMANOVA_.

The aim of this project is to simulate multivariate data sets and to compare the
outputs of a variety of analyses.

<i>I wish to make comparisons of  different data analysis approaches for multivariate species data.  The techniques I will investigate include the distance-based ANOSIM, and PERMANOVA, and the model-based mvabund and gllvm.
I'd like to simulate species datasets with known differences between 'groups' of samples and analyse these data to see which analysis methods are more sensitive to different properties of the data.
Please provide an overview of how I might go about this. I am using the R software package</i>
