<h2>Comparing approaches to multivariate data analysis</h2>

There has been much development in the last ~decade which promote the use of
model-based approaches to the analysis of the multivariate taxon data that
is commonly used in ecology.

Model-based approaches such as those adopted in R packages such as _mvabund_, _gllvm_, and
_Hmsc_ provide an alternative to the traditional approaches found in popular R
packages such as _vegan_ and commercial software packages such as _CANOCO_ and 
_PRIMER-E_ which have utlised distance-based approaches such as _ANOSIM_, and 
_PERMANOVA_.

The aim of this project is to simulate multivariate data sets and to compare the
outputs of a variety of analyses.

<h3>I asked ChatGPT how to approach this</h3>
**Prompt**

<i>I wish to make comparisons of  different data analysis approaches for multivariate species data.  The techniques I will investigate include the distance-based ANOSIM, and PERMANOVA, and the model-based mvabund and gllvm.
I'd like to simulate species datasets with known differences between 'groups' of samples and analyse these data to see which analysis methods are more sensitive to different properties of the data.
Please provide an overview of how I might go about this. I am using the R software package</i>

**Response**

Certainly! Here's an overview of how you could simulate species datasets with known differences between groups of samples and analyze them using various techniques in R:

-Simulating Data:
        Decide on the characteristics of your simulated data, such as the number of species, the number of samples, and the number of groups.
        Choose appropriate distributions for simulating species abundances within each group. Common choices include Poisson, negative binomial, or zero-inflated distributions.
        Introduce differences between groups by varying parameters of the distribution, such as means or variances.
        Use functions from packages like mvabund or gllvm to generate simulated data. For example, rcomp function in mvabund package can be used for compositional data.

-Data Analysis:
        Perform distance-based analysis using techniques like ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) and PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance).
        Implement model-based approaches using packages like mvabund and gllvm.
        For distance-based analysis, you can use functions like anosim and adonis from the vegan package.
        For model-based approaches, you can use functions provided by the respective packages (mvabund, gllvm) for fitting models to the data.

-Evaluation:
        Evaluate the performance of each method in detecting the known differences between groups by comparing their statistical outputs, such as p-values, effect sizes, or model fit statistics.
        Consider the sensitivity and specificity of each method in correctly identifying differences between groups.
        Explore the assumptions underlying each method and assess whether they are met by your simulated data.

-Visualization:
        Visualize the results using appropriate plots and graphs to illustrate the differences between groups and the effectiveness of each analysis method.
        Common visualizations include ordination plots (e.g., PCoA, NMDS) to visualize patterns in multivariate data, and boxplots or heatmaps to display differences in species abundances between groups.

-Reproducibility:
        Ensure reproducibility of your analysis by documenting your code and the parameters used for data simulation and analysis.
        Consider creating a script or a notebook that others can use to replicate your analysis.

Here's a simplified example code snippet to get you started:
``# Load required packages
library(mvabund)
library(gllvm)
library(vegan)

# Simulate data
set.seed(123)
n_species <- 50
n_samples <- 100
n_groups <- 2

# Simulate compositional data
sim_data <- rcomp(n = n_samples, K = n_species, g = n_groups)

# Perform analysis
# Distance-based analysis
anosim_result <- anosim(sim_data$abund, sim_data$group)
permanova_result <- adonis(sim_data$abund ~ sim_data$group)

# Model-based analysis
mvabund_model <- manyglm(sim_data$abund ~ sim_data$group, family = "negative.binomial")
gllvm_model <- gllvm(sim_data$abund, design = sim_data$group)

# Evaluate and visualize results
print(anosim_result)
print(permanova_result)
summary(mvabund_model)
summary(gllvm_model)
