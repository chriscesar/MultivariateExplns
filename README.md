<h2>Comparing approaches to multivariate data analysis</h2>

There has been much development in the last ~decade which promote the use of
model-based approaches to the analysis of the multivariate taxon data that
is commonly used in ecology.

Model-based approaches such as those adopted in R packages such as _mvabund_, _gllvm_, and
_Hmsc_ provide an alternative to the traditional approaches found in popular R
packages such as _vegan_ and commercial software packages such as _CANOCO_ and 
_PRIMER-E_ which have utlised distance-based approaches such as _ANOSIM_, and 
_PERMANOVA_.

The aim of this project is to simulate multivariate data sets and to compare the
outputs of a variety of analyses.

<h3>I asked ChatGPT how to approach this</h3>
<b>Prompt</b>

I wish to make comparisons of  different data analysis approaches for multivariate species data.  The techniques I will investigate include the distance-based ANOSIM, and PERMANOVA, and the model-based mvabund and gllvm.
I'd like to simulate species datasets with known differences between 'groups' of samples and analyse these data to see which analysis methods are more sensitive to different properties of the data.
Please provide an overview of how I might go about this. I am using the R software package

<b>Response</b>

Certainly! Here's an overview of how you could simulate species datasets with known differences between groups of samples and analyze them using various techniques in R:

* Simulating Data:
        Decide on the characteristics of your simulated data, such as the number of species, the number of samples, and the number of groups. Choose appropriate distributions for simulating species abundances within each group. Common choices include Poisson, negative binomial, or zero-inflated distributions. Introduce differences between groups by varying parameters of the distribution, such as means or variances. Use functions from packages like mvabund or gllvm to generate simulated data. For example, rcomp function in mvabund package can be used for compositional data.

* Data Analysis:
        Perform distance-based analysis using techniques like ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) and PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance). Implement model-based approaches using packages like mvabund and gllvm. For distance-based analysis, you can use functions like anosim and adonis from the vegan package. For model-based approaches, you can use functions provided by the respective packages (mvabund, gllvm) for fitting models to the data.

* Evaluation:
        Evaluate the performance of each method in detecting the known differences between groups by comparing their statistical outputs, such as p-values, effect sizes, or model fit statistics. Consider the sensitivity and specificity of each method in correctly identifying differences between groups. Explore the assumptions underlying each method and assess whether they are met by your simulated data.

* Visualization:
        Visualize the results using appropriate plots and graphs to illustrate the differences between groups and the effectiveness of each analysis method. Common visualizations include ordination plots (e.g., PCoA, NMDS) to visualize patterns in multivariate data, and boxplots or heatmaps to display differences in species abundances between groups.

* Reproducibility:
        Ensure reproducibility of your analysis by documenting your code and the parameters used for data simulation and analysis. Consider creating a script or a notebook that others can use to replicate your analysis.

Here's a simplified example code snippet to get you started:


    # Load required packages
    library(mvabund)
    library(gllvm)
    library(vegan)
    
    # Simulate data
    set.seed(123)
    n_species <- 50
    n_samples <- 100
    n_groups <- 2
    
    # Simulate compositional data
    # here chatGPT uses a function that doesn't actually exist:
    #sim_data <- rcomp(n = n_samples, K = n_species, g = n_groups)
    
    # After some cajoling, it provides an alternative approach, simulating data using the rpois function:
    sim_data <- matrix(rpois(n_species * n_samples * n_groups, lambda = 5), nrow = n_samples * n_groups, ncol = n_species)
    colnames(sim_data) <- paste0("Species", 1:n_species)
    group <- rep(1:n_groups, each = n_samples)
    
    # Perform analysis
    # Distance-based analysis
    anosim_result <- anosim(sim_data, group)
    permanova_result <- adonis2(sim_data ~ group)
    
    # Model-based analysis
    mvabund_model <- manyglm(sim_data ~ group, family = "negative.binomial")
    gllvm_model <- gllvm(sim_data, design = group, family="negative.binomial")
    
    # Evaluate and visualize results
    print(anosim_result)
    print(permanova_result)
    summary(mvabund_model)
    summary(gllvm_model)
    
    # We can also use a negative binomial approach:
    # Function to simulate negative binomial data
    simulate_neg_binomial <- function(n_samples, n_species, n_groups, mu, size) {
    sim_data <- matrix(0, nrow = n_samples * n_groups, ncol = n_species)
    for (i in 1:(n_samples * n_groups)) {
    sim_data[i, ] <- rnbinom(n_species, mu = mu, size = size)
    }
    return(sim_data)
    }
    
    # Simulate data
    set.seed(123)
    n_species <- 50
    n_samples <- 100
    n_groups <- 2
    mu <- 5
    size <- 1  # Negative binomial dispersion parameter
    
    # Simulate compositional data with negative binomial distribution
    sim_data <- simulate_neg_binomial(n_samples, n_species, n_groups, mu, size)
    colnames(sim_data) <- paste0("Species", 1:n_species)
    group <- rep(1:n_groups, each = n_samples)
    
    # Perform analysis
    # Distance-based analysis
    anosim_result <- anosim(sim_data, group)
    permanova_result <- adonis2(as.data.frame(sim_data) ~ group)
    
    # Model-based analysis
    mvabund_model <- manyglm(sim_data ~ group, family = "negative.binomial")
    gllvm_model <- gllvm(sim_data, design = group, family="negative.binomial")
    
    # Evaluate and visualize results
    print(anosim_result)
    print(permanova_result)
    summary(mvabund_model)
    summary(gllvm_model)
    
Remember to adapt the above code according to your specific simulation settings and analysis requirements. Additionally, consult the documentation of each package for detailed usage instructions and options

<h3>Comparing impacts of effect sizes and distribution parameters</h3>
<b>Prompt</b>
I'd be interested in assessing how differences in both the size of the difference between my two treatment 'groups'  and the mean-variance relationship within the simulated data affects the outcomes of the analysis.  Suggest an approach for this 
<b>Response</b>
To assess how differences in the size of the difference between your treatment groups and the mean-variance relationship within the simulated data affect the outcomes of the analysis, you can conduct a simulation study where you systematically vary these parameters and observe the resulting analysis outcomes. Here's a suggested approach:

* Define Parameter Ranges: Determine the ranges of values for the parameters you want to investigate. For example:
        - Size of the difference between groups (effect size).
        - Mean-variance relationship parameters (e.g., mean abundance, dispersion parameter for negative binomial distribution).

* Design Simulation Study: Set up a design for your simulation study. You may want to use a factorial design where you systematically vary the parameters of interest. For example:
        - Vary the effect size between groups.
        - Vary the mean abundance and dispersion parameter within groups.

* Simulate Data: Based on the design, simulate data for each combination of parameter values. You can use the previously defined function to simulate negative binomial data with different mean and dispersion parameters.

* Perform Analysis: Analyze each simulated dataset using the chosen statistical methods (e.g., ANOSIM, PERMANOVA). Keep track of the outcomes such as p-values, effect sizes, or any other relevant metrics.

* Evaluate Results: Assess how the outcomes of the analysis change as you vary the parameters of interest. Look for trends or patterns in the results.

* Visualization and Interpretation: Visualize the results to understand the impact of varying parameters on the analysis outcomes. You may use plots such as scatterplots, heatmaps, or boxplots to visualize the relationships between parameters and analysis outcomes.

* Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests or modeling techniques to quantify the relationships between parameters and analysis outcomes.

* Sensitivity Analysis: Perform sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of your findings to different modeling assumptions or variations in parameter values.

* Documentation and Reporting: Document your simulation study thoroughly, including details of parameter values, simulation methods, analysis procedures, and results. Prepare a report summarizing your findings and conclusions.

Here's a simplified example code snippet to demonstrate how you can conduct such a simulation study:

    # Define parameter ranges
    effect_sizes <- c(0.5, 1, 1.5)  # Effect size between groups
    mean_abundances <- c(5, 10, 15)  # Mean abundances within groups
    dispersion_parameters <- c(0.5, 1, 2)  # Dispersion parameters within groups
    
    # Simulation study
    results <- list()
    
    for (effect_size in effect_sizes) {
      for (mean_abundance in mean_abundances) {
        for (dispersion_parameter in dispersion_parameters) {
          # Simulate data
          sim_data <- simulate_neg_binomial(n_samples, n_species, n_groups, mean_abundance, dispersion_parameter)
          group <- rep(1:n_groups, each = n_samples)
          
          # Perform analysis
          anosim_result <- anosim(sim_data, group)
          permanova_result <- adonis2(as.data.frame(sim_data) ~ group)
          
          # Store results
          results[[paste(effect_size, mean_abundance, dispersion_parameter, sep = "_")]] <- list(
            ANOSIM = anosim_result,
            PERMANOVA = permanova_result
          )
        }
      }
    }
    
    # Visualize results
    # For example, create plots or summarize statistics from the results list

In this code, we loop through different combinations of effect sizes, mean abundances, and dispersion parameters, simulate data for each combination, perform analysis using ANOSIM and PERMANOVA, and store the results. You can then analyze and visualize the results to understand the impact of varying parameters on the analysis outcomes.
